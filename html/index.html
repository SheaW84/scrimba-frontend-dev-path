    <h1>This Is Me Again</h1>
    <p>Here we are back at again trying to get something old of the ground.<br>
        I don't know if this has become my passion again or something that I can't just let
        go of. 
    </p>
    <p>I think that it might be the latter but can you really help something you're obsessed over?<br>
        Don't answer that. Maybe this time things will work out for the best. 
    </p>
    <p>Maybe if I set my goals a bit lower, I can reach my ultimate dream.. <br>I just didn't want to be too old 
        to enjoy the fruits of my labor.
